Erase is an interactive piece that invites users to erase photographs of child labor taken by Lewis Hine in the US during the 1900s. Upon erasing, the viewer sees the image below it which was taken by me in 2016 when I took a trip to Bangladesh to see the insides of garment factories. Most of these photographs are in a swindling factory where thread is made before it is sent out to the garment factories.

The project is to bring forward awareness that we have not truly gotten rid of child labor, rather, we have exported this labor. It is not to say that we must do everything we can to get rid of child labor, for you cannot get rid of the second image. 
<br><br>
There are several factors involved in a country not having child labor. In Bangladesh, for example, there isn’t really such a thing as unemployment benefits, or medicare, so if a parents becomes ill or disabled in any way, a child must work to keep the household surviving. If there isn’t work, they must resort to begging which doesn’t work in a place as saturated as Bangladesh.
<br><br>
The piece is to show that it’s very naive to think we don’t have the guilt of child labor on our hands and at the same time to say that perhaps the goal isn’t necessarily to obliterate all child labor - rather, it’s to be aware that this is the reality, and to make the reality better - to create better working conditions for the children. To create safer work environments and regulations put in place so wages are paid on time and there is less exploiting than there is now.
